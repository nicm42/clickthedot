# Click the Dot

This game shows you a black circle and asks you click on it when you think it's twice the size. It's definitely possible to get it spot-on!

I created this to test using the DOM in Javascript to create HTML elements and add CSS. It's similar to jQuery (which I know) but different enough that knowing jQuery isn't that helpful. I did understand more about how to do it than just reading it, and playing about with the console log.
