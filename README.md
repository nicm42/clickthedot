# Click the Shape

This game shows you a shape (circle, square or triangle) and asks you click on it when you think it's twice the size.

The original was Click the Dot, which I created to learn more about DOM manipulation in Javascript. THis version has new features and looks a bit prettier. I also re-wrote the js in jQuery and the css in SCSS.
